Please open this read.me file in readme viewer for better experience!üòâ

There are two folders one is of the program is done by using command line interface and other program is done in GUI. I am pretty sure that there may be a lot of issues in GUI program that's why putting both folders.

Fun Fact: You can use any path for your audio files, still I have provided some audio files in "audio" folder.

### Instructions To Run Program with Command Line Interface

1) Open VS-Code solution file

2) Put Solution Configuration on Debug Mode

3) Put Solution Platforms on x64

4) Run the program by pressing (Ctrl+F5) or by clicking start without debugging button ‚ñ∂Ô∏è.

5) Command line interface will pop-up and then will ask for folder path wherever you have songs.

6) Put the folder path without double or single quotes like if the path looks like this ‚û°Ô∏è "C:\Users\onkar\Downloads" then you should enter it like this ‚û°Ô∏è C:\Users\onkar\Downloads.

7) Wait for all the songs to load.

8) Commands are shown on the screen and should look like commands mentioned at bottom of this readme file and if you press any of the key mentioned it will do the respective actions.

9) For unloading a single song the index of song will be asked and for unloading all songs it will be automatic if user chooses to unload all at once.

10) User cannot play two songs at once (I have intentionally done this). If user wants to play another song the first song will pause and user will be asked if he really wants to play another song or not.

11) Current playback position is also shown!

### Instructions To Run Program with GUI

I have used several different libraries like GLFW, GLAD, IMGUI, KHR just for the GUI purpose!

1) Open VS-Code solution file

2) Put Solution Configuration on Debug Mode

3) Put Solution Platforms on x64

4) Run the program by pressing (Ctrl+F5) or by clicking start without debugging button ‚ñ∂Ô∏è.

5) Command line interface will pop-up but just ignore it this time and click on the new window which shows GUI and then it asks for the folder path wherever you have songs.

6) Put the folder path without double or single quotes like if the path looks like this ‚û°Ô∏è "C:\Users\onkar\Downloads" then you should enter it like this ‚û°Ô∏è C:\Users\onkar\Downloads.   ![Screenshot](MediaPlayer_With_GUI/GUI1.png)

7) Wait for all the songs to load. If there are lot of songs in the folder and only few of them are supported formats then also only supported formats will be loaded.   ![Screenshot](MediaPlayer_With_GUI/GUI2.png)

8) Whenever user clicks on any of the songs shown in list the song plays. If a song is already playing and user clicks on another song then first song will stop and next will play (Intentionally done).   ![Screenshot](MediaPlayer_With_GUI/GUI3.png)

9) Volume, pitch and pan can be set by setting the slider position.   ![Screenshot](MediaPlayer_With_GUI/GUI.png)

10) For Unloading songs two choices are given if user wants to unload a specific song or he/she wants to unload all songs at once.

11) Quit button is for quitting the program.

12) Pause, resume and stop will do the actions of pausing, resuming and stopping the sound.

13) Current playback position is also shown!
